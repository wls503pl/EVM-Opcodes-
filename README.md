# Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) Operation Codes

- Opcodes Introduction
Opcodes are the basic unit of Ethereum smart contracts. The Solidity smart contracts written by everyone will be compiled into bytecodes before they can be run on EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine). The bytecode is composed of a series of Opcodes. When the user calls the function of this smart contract in EVM, EVM will parse and execute these Opcodes to implement the contract logic.
